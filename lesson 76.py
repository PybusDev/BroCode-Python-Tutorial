# Generator Expression = Similar to a list comprehension but uses () instead of []
#                        Creates a generator (iterator) that yields values one at a time
#                        No need to define a function or use yield
#                        Less flexible than a gen func and not reusable
#                        gen object = (expression for value in iterable if condition)



# ================= EXAMPLE 1 =================

number = int(input("Enter a number to count up to: "))

counter = (count for count in range(1, number + 1))

for n in counter:
   print(n)



# ================= EXAMPLE 2 =================

file_path = "C:\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\test.txt" # ADD YOUR OWN FILE PATH, IT DOES WORK FOR ME

with open(file_path) as file:
   lines = (line.strip() for line in file)
   for line in lines:
       print(line)



# ================= EXAMPLE 3 =================

number = int(input("Enter a number to square up to: "))

even_squares = (x**2 for x in range(1, number + 1) if x % 2 == 0)

for square in even_squares:
   print(square)
