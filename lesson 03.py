# typecasting = The process of converting a value of one data type to another
#               (string, integer, float, boolean)
#               Explicit vs Implicit

# ========== EXPLICIT ==========

# name = "Bro"
# age = 21
# gpa = 1.9
# student = True

# print(type(name))
# print(type(age))
# print(type(gpa))
# print(type(student))

# age = float(age)
# print(age)

# gpa = int(gpa)
# print(gpa)

# student = str(student)
# print(student)
# print((type(student)))

# age = bool(age)
# print(age)

# name = bool(name)
# print(name)
